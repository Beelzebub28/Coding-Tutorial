		<h1>If Statements</h1>
		<br><br>
			<p>
				If your new to programming, this will be a great tutorial for the fundamentals of programming logic. An if statement is one of a few ways to do something when a condition is set. It helps control the flow of your coding logic.
			</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<h3>In English:</h3>
			<br>
			<p>	If you are thristy, take a drink.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>
				We are just going to assume that from now that the code in the examples are embedded in the &lt;script&gt; tags that are in the body of an HTML document
			</p>
			<br><br><br>	
			<h3 class="result">
				Example
			</h3>
			<div class="codes" style="height:15rem">	
			<p class="code">
			var thirsty = true;<br>
			var drank = false;<br>
			if(thirsty == true)  //notice the ==<br>
			&#123;
			&emsp;drank = true;<br>
			&emsp;document.write(drank);<br>
			&#125;
			</p>
		</div>
			<br><br>
			<h3 class="result">Result</h3>
			<br><br>
			<p>true </p>
			<br><br>
			<p>The == is one of the comparison operators. It is not the same as = that sets a variable or property equal to something. Since, the variable thirsty does equal true the if is executed. If the statement would have said if(thirsty == false), drank would not have been set to true.
			</p>

				Example
			</h3>
			<div class="codes">	
			<p class="code">
			var x = 7;<br>
			if(x===7)<br>
			&#123; <br>
			    //this would be executed<br>
			&#125;<br>
			if(x==="7")<br>
			&#123;<br>
			    //this would not be executed because === is a strict operator that makes sure that the variable is set to the correct value and type of the conditional variable. The conditional variable here is is "7"<br>
			&#125;<br>
			if(x!=8)<br>
			&#123;<br>
			    //this would be executed because != means that the variable is not equal to the conditional variable<br>
			&#125;<br>
			if(x>8)<br>
			&#123;<br>
			    //Since 7 is not greater 8, this would not be executed<br>
			&#125;<br>
			if(x<8)<br>
			&#123;<br>
			    //Since 8 greater 7, this would be executed<br>
			&#125;<br>
			if(x>=7)<br>
			&#123;<br>
			    //Since 7 is equal 7, this would be executed<br>
			&#125;<br>
			if(x<=6)<br>
			&#123;<br>
			    //Since 7 is not less than or equal to 6 this would not be executed<br>
			&#125;<br>

			var x = 7;<br>
			if(x===7)<br>
			&#123; <br>
			    //this would be executed<br>
			&#125;<br>
			if(x==="7")<br>
			&#123;<br>
			    //this would not be executed because === is a strict operator that makes sure that the variable is set to the correct value and type of the conditional variable. The conditional variable here is is "7"<br>
			&#125;<br>
			if(x!=8)<br>
			&#123;<br>
			    //this would be executed because != means that the variable is not equal to the conditional variable<br>
			&#125;<br>
			if(x>8)<br>
			&#123;<br>
			    //Since 7 is not greater 8, this would not be executed<br>
			&#125;<br>
			if(x<8)<br>
			&#123;<br>
			    //Since 8 greater 7, this would be executed<br>
			&#125;<br>
			if(x>=7)<br>
			&#123;<br>
			    //Since 7 is equal 7, this would be executed<br>
			&#125;<br>
			if(x<=6)<br>
			&#123;<br>
			    //Since 7 is not less than or equal to 6 this would not be executed<br>
			&#125;<br>
			
			</p>
		</div>
			<br><br>
			<p>
				The comparison operators are extremely useful, but they are not just restricted to integers. For example, if(x == “example”) would return false, since 7 is not equal to the string “example”.
